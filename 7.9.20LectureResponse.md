#### 1.What is TF Hub?  How did you use it when creating your script for “text classification of movie reviews”?
 TensorFlow (TF) Hub is a library that contains the reusable parts of ML models that can be used for training models. In the script for "text classification of movie reviews" I used TF Hub to pre-trained text embedding model text is to convert sentences into embeddings vectors, processes the text and plits it up based on spaces

#### 2.What are the optimizer and loss functions?  How good was your “text classification of movie reviews” model?
binary_crossentropy loss function, this is a binary classification problem and the model outputs logits (a single-unit layer with a linear activation).  binary_crossentropy is better for dealing with probabilities—it measures the "distance" between probability distributions, or in our case, between the ground-truth distribution and the predictions

optimizer='adam'
#### 3.In “text classification with preprocessed text” you produced a graph of training and validation loss.  Add the graph to this response and provide a brief explanation.

#### 4.Likewise do the same for the training and validation accuracy graph.
