I modeled my project off of the linear regression tensorflow exercise that we did earlier in the class as the goal of this project was to predict a continuous value (i.e population). The fact that this was a regression problem informed all of the decisions I made when I was compiling my model. For my loss function I decided to use MSE because MSE is good for regression problems. For my optimizer I decided to use Adam. I was initially going to use RMSprop because it has such a fast learning rate, but I did some reading on optimizers and it seemed like Adam would take the best parts of RMSprop and another technique (Momentum) and combine them, which I thought would be best for my model. I used 0.001 as my learning rate just to get things started because initially I had no idea what a good learning rate would be. Finally, when compiling my model I decided the metrics that would best indicate how well my model was working were MAE and MSE as MAE (Mean absolute error) could tell me the average difference observed in the predicted and actual values across the whole data set (a lower score is better) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) would tell me what the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual values for the data set.
