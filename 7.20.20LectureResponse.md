### Problem Statement 

### Describe your implementation of the cats & dogs exercise. How did you setup the data?

  The key to solving a vast majority of the worlds problems lies with women. Poverty, climate change/habitat destruction, forced migration, overpopulation to name a few, can all be solved (or maybe solved is too strong a word, but certainly ameliorated) by educating women. Research by the UN shows that when women are educated they are able to effectively implement family planning practices that guard against overpopulation and poverty. Moreover, when they are educated research shows that women are most likely to re-invest in their communities by creating healthy and sustainable community networks and practices (like co-ops, sustainable farming practices, or community microloans programs) and helping to lift their families out of poverty via investing in their children's educations. Women hold the key to a better, more sustainable future, but they need to have access to education in order to reach their true potential and effectively enact change. 

  As of right now "women make up more than two-thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate people. According to global statistics, just 39 percent of rural girls attend secondary school. This is far fewer than rural boys (45 percent), urban girls (59 percent) and urban boys (60 percent)" (UNwomen.org, facts and figures, education). The farther away from school a woman lives, especially in rural areas, the less likely she is to attend school due to time constraints as well as an increase in the threat of violence she might face as she travels farther distances. So the fix for so many of the world problems? in the most simplisitc terms: more schools in rural areas that are in close proximity to the women they are meant to serve.

  To solve the problem of the lack of access to education in the rural female population, we must first get a better idea of where schools are currently located in relation to the women they are meant to serve. After conducting this research we must identify areas where there is a high population of rural women but no school nearby. Once these sites are located they can be targeted as potential spots to either build schools or enact some form of educational program for these women. Using machine learning we can identfy where schools are, where rural women are clustered, and the available means of transportation/roads that they could or do use to get an education; we could also calculate how far women are from schools/educational sites. 
  
  Equal access to education for women is a complex issue; there are many societal factors at play that determine how women are allowed to interact with the public, recieve their education, or even how they are allowed to just live their life in general. At a regional level women, especially rural women, are discouraged from recieving an education due to societal restrictions/customs, a lack of safety when traveling, a lack of value placed on thier education and a lack of sanitation facilities. On a  global level a lack of interest and funding works against achieving widespread access to education for women. Simply adding more schools for women will not solve all of the problems, but identifying areas of educational deficits (in terms of a lack of educational resources and facilities for women) is the first step in being able to provide women with educational faciliaties that truly acount for the realities of life they face (societal restriction, violence, family/community expectation) and that are located a safe and manageable distance away. Researching the spatial relationship between rural women in areas across the globe and educational facilities and how that relationship impact women's access to education is the first step to bettering the lives of women, which helps better the state of their communities, which in turn better the entire world.

####  Question One: Which optimizer have you selected, and how might it compare to other possible choices?  
For this lab I used the RMSprop optimizer. RMSprop is unique as an optimizer because it tries to find a single global learning rate for the entire algorithm by considering both the size of the step for each weight as well as the sign of the gradient at any given point. If, after taking a step, the sign of the magnitude of the gradient are the same, then the optimizer knows it is moving in the right direction, if the signs are different then it is a step in the wrong direction. As the step size adapts over time the rate of learning accelerate and it does so in the correct direction. RMSprop also keeps the moving average of the squared gradients for each weight so that the mini-batches are divided by a similar number each time. This setup allows RMSprop to be a quick and incredibly useful optimizer. 

#### Question two: Describe your selected loss function and it’s implementation. How is it effectively penalizing bad predictions? 
I selected binary crossentropy as my loss function for this code. Since this is a binary classification problem, after fitting the model, the model assigns each data point with a probability of it belonging to one of the classes. After the model produces the predicted probabilities, the loss function then evaluates how accurate these predictions were based on the true values of each data point. A high probability score indicates low loss, whereas a low probability score indicated high loss. The overall loss is caluclated by finding the negative log of each probability and then computing the mean of all the losses. Specifically, with cross-entropy, this loss function computes the entropy (or the uncertainty in regards to a data point belonging to a certain class) of the true values of the distribution of data points as well as of the predicted values for the distribution. The closer the two values are the lower the cross-entropy. A low cross-entropy value is desirable as it indicates that the predicted value was close to the true value of the data point.  

#### Question 3: What is the purpose of the metric= argument in your model.compile() function?
The metrics argument in my model.compile function is meant to judge the performance of the model (but the results arent used for training the model). In this case the metric that was being tracked in this model was the accuracy of the model, or how often the predicted labels matched the actual labels of the data given to the model. 

#### Question 4: Plot the accuracy and loss results for both the training and test datasets.  Include these in your response.  Assess the model and describe how good you think it performed.

These graphs show that the model is relatively accurate, the validation accuracy score was around 80% and the traning accuracy score was above 95%. However, the training accuracy is higher than the validation accuracy which indicates that the model is overfit. Additionall, the validation loss curve is going up which is another indication that the model is overfit.

#### Question five: Use the model to predict 3 dog images and 3 cat images.  Upload you images and the prediction.  How did your model perform in practice?  Do you have any ideas of how to improve the model’s performance?
These were the images I chose to testg. Three of them are of my cat Poncho (the orange one), one was of my kittens,Louie and Adele, and two were of my dog, Abby.

Truth be told, this model performed horribly in practice. Of the four cat pictures it guessed that ALL of them were dogs and of the dog pictures it only accurately predicted that one of them was a dog. The only picutre this model accurately predicted was the picture of my dog lying belly-up in her dog bed, which I thought the model would struggle with the most. I think perhaps the lighting and position of the animals had some impact on how well the model worked, but overall it did not do well. Perhaps to improve this model I could try to use different optimizer and loss functions or increase the amount of epochs the training data has to go through. Additionally better feature selection might be useful, but it would be hard to decide on which features to focus on since cats and dogs look so much alike.
