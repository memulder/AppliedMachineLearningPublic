### Problem Statement 

### Describe your implementation of the cats & dogs exercise. How did you setup the data?

####  Question One: Which optimizer have you selected, and how might it compare to other possible choices?   

#### Question two: .Describe your selected loss function and it’s implementation. How is it effectively penalizing bad predictions? 

#### Question 3: What is the purpose of the metric= argument in your model.compile() function? (look here - https://keras.io/api/metrics/)

#### Question 4: Plot the accuracy and loss results for both the training and test datasets.  Include these in your response.  Assess the model and describe how good you think it performed.

#### Question five: Use the model to predict 3 dog images and 3 cat images.  Upload you images and the prediction.  How did your model perform in practice?  Do you have any ideas of how to improve the model’s performance?
