Originally, my idea for this project was to use an image of interlocking circles as my content image and one of Alexander Calder's drawings of his sculptures/mobiles. To me data science is the epitome of an interdisciplinary field and I thought interlocking circles would be a good representation of data science and the Jump Start program. Calder is my favorite artist and I thought his geometric designs would speak to the math behind data science and his bold colors would make the end design pop. However, I had trouble loading the images into PyCharm. In trying to solve my problem I stumbled across googles open source images and so my image choices changed. For my content image I chose an image of the sculpture "Disk in the Form of a Desert Rose" by Arnaldo Pomodoro, I thought it was a good representation of how often in data science (and especially with machine learning) there is a lot of work, many moving parts, that are hidden behind the nice veneer of an easy to use interface or data visualization. On that note I like how in the sculpture you could see both the inner workings and outer form of the design;I thought this scuplture would show all the many layers of computers and of data sicence itself. I chose the image of the kite as my style image mostly because I was curious about how the computer would adapt it to the content image considering that the only stylized element is centered in the image. Moreover, the design on the kite reminded me a bit of calder's designs. These were the two images I chose:

This is what the image looked like after the high frequency components have increased:

This was the final image I produced:

This design was not what I initially envisioned but like in any endevor in data science in trying to solve one problem I accidentally stumbled upon a fix that, while unexpected, made my code and product all that much better. 

For my final design I put the stylized image in grayscale and added a few additional elements to really make the shirt worthy of the Jump Start Program.

I think this version is my favorite one. I turned off the background color to my image and then chose some bright colors for the remaining points and the end product is sort of my own personal representation/interpretation of a neural network or the connection between data nodes.
